// 1 - Create a variable called 'phrase' and assign it the value of an empty string
var phrase = '';

// 2 - Update the phrase variable by assigning it a value of "The rain in Spain falls gently on the plain"
phrase = "The rain in Spain falls gently on the plain";

// 3 - Console log the length of phrase
console.log(phrase);

// 4 - Console log the word Spain by using the substring method
console.log(phrase.substring(12,17));

// 5 - Append the value ". The end." to the phrase variable.

//I decided to log the phrase but don't think I really needed to... And yes, Spain kicks ass.
console.log(phrase + '. The end.');
